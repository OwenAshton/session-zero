# Session 0 checklist

Below is a list of some questions to thing about / prepare for session 0.

We will also be discussing how I like to DM and will be setting some base ground rules. These Rules are not set in stone, so if there is anything you don’t like we will discuss it and come up with a compromise.

1. What are you most looking forward to about playing DND?
2. What do you think you will prefer more:
	a. Combat
	b. Puzzles
	c. Exploration
	d. Roleplaying
	e. Adventures
3. Of the above list, are there any you actively dislike?
4. Of the above list, are there any you haven’t tried but would like to?
5. How have you built your character?
	a. Story first, I couldn’t care if he’s optimized
	b. I have a build in mind, but I also couldn’t care if it’s min/maxed
	c. Min/Max all the way! This is the pinnacle of the meta
	d. Yeeeeeeahhh this is a cheese build, I’m so sorry
	e. Yes, this is a character, I think he has spells.
6. How much would you like your characters backstory to have an impact in the game world? Are there any important background events that you would like to be starting canon?
7. What level of agency do you want? How rail roady do you want the adventure to be?
8. What story topics are off limit? How PG-13 do you want the campaign? Are anyone’s kids going to be following along with the story?
9. What story theme are you interested in? High realism? Grim dark? High adventure? More casual good vs evil? Swashbuckling adventure? Loot crawler?
10.  What level of seriousness do you prefer? Comedy vs drama?
11. Do you have any pet peeves that people do that you would like to discuss?
